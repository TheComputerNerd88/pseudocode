# SCSA Pseudocode Interpreter (Very WIP as of now)
Pseudocode, based on the Western Australian ATAR Computer Science "Pseudocode" specification, which is so specific that it might as well be a real langauge.

# Features
- handwritten Lexer

# Planned features
- Pratt Parser
- Simple tree walker
- Bytecode VM
- Garbage Collector

- Object Oriented Programming✨
