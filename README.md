# SCSA Pseudocode Interpreter (Very WIP as of now)
Pseudocode, based on the Western Australian ATAR Computer Science "Pseudocode" specification, which is so specific that it might as well be a real langauge.
Well guess what?

# Features
- Handwritten Lexer
- Pratt Parser
- Simple tree walker

# WIP
- Object Oriented Programming✨
    - This was a new, painful, stupid addition to the SCSA pseudocode "standard", when they decided that their ancient Pascal based pseudocode had to appeal to the super new (30 year old) trendy OOP
- Lists appending

# Planned features
- Bytecode VM
- Garbage Collector
